\section{Introduction}

This project aims to design an Ethereum smart contract that enables the verification of blocks of the Binance Smart Chain blockchain (BSC) on the Ethereum blockchain in a trustless and decentralized way. This means a user can send a request to the Ethereum chain asking whether or not a certain block has been included in the BSC chain. The Ethereum chain then provides a reliable and truthful answer without relying on any trusted third party.
